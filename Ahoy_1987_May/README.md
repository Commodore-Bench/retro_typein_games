# Moondog for C64 - description from the magazine

By James C. Hilty

Some people refer to you as a mercenary, while others
look upon you as a futuristic Robin Hood. The truth
probably lies somewhere in between. It seems whenever
a friendly planet is in danger of alien invasion, you
are there with your famous spacecraft, the Moondog.

The peaceful planet Yoma was under attack by two swift
alien vessels. You and the Moondog were able to capture
these ships and were towing them away with your tractor
beam. Suddenly, another attack was launched against Yoma.
An entire fleet of alien craft was speeding toward the plan-
et to rescue their two ships. You must defend Yoma!

This is the background for Moondog, an arcade game
for the C-64. After the title screen the playing screen is
displayed. The Moondog is at the lower center of the screen.
The two ships you have captured flank you on the left and
right. You control left and right movement of the Moondog
with a joystick in Port 2. The fire button fires your laser.
Once an alien attack ship appears, he begins moving in a
random pattern. Your goal is to shoot him as soon as po:
sible without crashing into one of the two s! jou have
previously captured. If you do not hit the attacking ship
fast enough, he will move in and rescue the two captured
ships. Suddenly an asteroid storm develops. The asteroids
are so dense that your laser cannot destroy them. If one
of them hits the Moondog, you are history.

The Moondog has unlimited energy. You may keep your
finger glued to the fire button and fire away. However, when
you do this, you lose control of left and right movement.
Once you start moving in a direction, you continue until
you change direction with the joystick. You must stop fir-
ing momentarily to do this.

You begin the game with four ships. A ship is lost if you
crash into one of the alien ships flanking you, or if an as-
teroid hits you. A ship is also lost if you take too long to
hit an attacking ship. The sooner you hit an attacking ship,
the more points you earn.

Your work is cut out for you and the Moondog. This is
your most dangerous mission. Are you as good a pilot as
rumored? Let's find out by playing Moondog.
