## BUG REPELLENT FOR THE 64 & 128 (description from the magazine)
By Buck Childress

Please note: the Bug Repellent programs listed here are for Ahoy! program published from the May 1987 issue onward! For older programs, use the older version.

Type in, save, and run Bug Repellent. You'll be asked if you want automatic saves to take place. If so, you're prompted for the device, DISK (D) or TAPE (T). You then pick a starting file number, 0 through 99. Next, you enter a name, up to 14 characters long. At this point, Bug Repellent verifies your entries and gives you a chance to change them if you want. If no changes are needed, Bug Repellent activates itself. (Pressing RETURN without answering the prompts defaults to disk drive and begins your files with “OOBACKUP”

As you enter program lines and press RETURN, a Bug Repellent code appears at the top of your screen. If it doesn’t match the code in the program listing, an error exists. Correct the line and the codes will match.

If used, automatic saves take place every 15 minutes. When the RETURN key is pressed on a program line, the screen changes color to let you know that a save will begin in about three seconds. You may cancel the save by pressing the RUN STOP key. The file number increments after cach save. It resets to 00 if 99 is surpassed. After saving, or cancelling, the screen returns to its original color and the timer resets for 15 minutes.

When you've finished using Bug Repellent, deactivate it by typing SYS 49152 [RETURN] for the Commodore 64 or SYS 4864 [RETURN] for the Commodore 128.

## Moondog for C64 - description from the magazine

By James C. Hilty

Some people refer to you as a mercenary, while others
look upon you as a futuristic Robin Hood. The truth
probably lies somewhere in between. It seems whenever
a friendly planet is in danger of alien invasion, you
are there with your famous spacecraft, the Moondog.

The peaceful planet Yoma was under attack by two swift
alien vessels. You and the Moondog were able to capture
these ships and were towing them away with your tractor
beam. Suddenly, another attack was launched against Yoma.
An entire fleet of alien craft was speeding toward the plan-
et to rescue their two ships. You must defend Yoma!

This is the background for Moondog, an arcade game
for the C-64. After the title screen the playing screen is
displayed. The Moondog is at the lower center of the screen.
The two ships you have captured flank you on the left and
right. You control left and right movement of the Moondog
with a joystick in Port 2. The fire button fires your laser.
Once an alien attack ship appears, he begins moving in a
random pattern. Your goal is to shoot him as soon as po:
sible without crashing into one of the two s! jou have
previously captured. If you do not hit the attacking ship
fast enough, he will move in and rescue the two captured
ships. Suddenly an asteroid storm develops. The asteroids
are so dense that your laser cannot destroy them. If one
of them hits the Moondog, you are history.

The Moondog has unlimited energy. You may keep your
finger glued to the fire button and fire away. However, when
you do this, you lose control of left and right movement.
Once you start moving in a direction, you continue until
you change direction with the joystick. You must stop fir-
ing momentarily to do this.

You begin the game with four ships. A ship is lost if you
crash into one of the alien ships flanking you, or if an as-
teroid hits you. A ship is also lost if you take too long to
hit an attacking ship. The sooner you hit an attacking ship,
the more points you earn.

Your work is cut out for you and the Moondog. This is
your most dangerous mission. Are you as good a pilot as
rumored? Let's find out by playing Moondog.
