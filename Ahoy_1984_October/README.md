## C-64 Bug Repellent (description from the magazine)

By Michael Kleinert and David Barron

The program listed below will allow you to quickly 
debug any Ahoy! program up until May 1987 you type
in on your C-64.  Starting with the May 1987 issue,
a different Bug Repellent version was used.

Type in, SAVE, and RUN the Bug Repellent.  Type NEW,
then type in or LOAD the Ahoy! progrnm you wish to
check.  When it's done, SAVE your program (don't RUN
it!) and type SYS 49152 [RETURN].  You'll be asked
if you want the line value codes displayed on the 
screen or dumped to the printer.  If you select screen,
it will appear there.

The table will move quickly, too quickly for most
mortals to follow.  To pause the listing, depress and 
hold the SHIFT key.  To pause for an extended period,
depress SHIFT LOCK.  As long as it is locked, the 
display will remain frozen.  

Compare the table your machine generates to the table
in Ahoy! that follows the program you're entering.
If you spot a difference, an error exists in the line.
Jot down the numbers of lines where contradictions
occur, LIST each line, spot the errors, and correct
them.

## Lawnjob for C64 - description from the magazine

By Michael Buhidar, Jr.

Lawn Job is a game in which you play the role of a lawn boy. As the game begins,
you are standing on the walkway in front of your customer's house looking over
the task at hand. You must first start your mower by pressing the fire button
on the joystick plugged into Control Port 2. As with the typical mower, it will
usually take several attempts to start. (Note: mower will not move prior to
starting.) After it starts you can begin to mow the lawn.

As you mow, you must be cautious not to hit the tree stumps or large rocks
which are scattered about the yard. Hitting these will cause your mower to
stop as well as cause excessive wear and tear to your mower. You will want to
avoid this as much as possible  because the extra time spent restarting the
mower plus the added wear and tear can lessen your final earnings considerably.

When your job is finished, you must maneuver your mower to the customer's front
porch and press the fire button. This stops your mower and prompts your
customer to come out and examine your work. You then must wait patiently while
your work is scrutinized. If your work is not finished. you will be told so and
you must restart the mower and finish the job.

When the job is completed and the customer is satisfied, your total earnings
from the job will be calculated. The amount of time you took (gas money) plus
fifty cents for each rock or tree stump that you hit (wear and tear) will be
subtracted from your base score in order to determine the total amount of
money that you earned for the job.
