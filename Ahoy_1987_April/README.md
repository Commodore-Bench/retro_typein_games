## Laps for C64 - description from the magazine

By James C. Hilty

The most famous auto race in the world, the Ion International 500, is scheduled to be run this weekend. You have always dreamed of winning the grand prize of one hundred thousand dol- lars in cash and a year's subscription to Ahoy! Unfortun- ately there can only be 20 cars in the race, and 19 posi- tions are already filled. You must post a better time in the qualifying laps than your opponent or it's wait till next year!
Laps is a two-player 3-D racing simulation for the C-64. The players take turns running three qualifying laps, and the racer with the best average time after the three laps is the winner. When the game is first run, a prompt asks for the names of the racers. If you wish to practice run- ning laps alone, simply press the RETURN key for each name; otherwise enter the name of each racer (up to 10 letters). The name of the first player is displayed on the screen. The speed is shown as 50 mph. The player car (red) cannot go slower than 50 mph or faster than 300 mph. The racer uses a joystick in Port 2. The same joy- stick is used by both players. To begin your lap, press the fire button. Pushing the joystick up increases your speed, while pushing it down slows you down. Pushing the stick left or right moves you left or right. After your lap is completed your time is shown in the bottom half of the screen. The second racer's name comes up and he runs his lap. This continues until each player has driv- en three laps. The average time for each racer is then calculated and a winner is declared.

THE TRACK
The upper half of the screen shows your car on a 3-D racing track with a city in the background. If you hit the red and white track boundaries during a lap, your car crashes, time is added to your lap time, and your car must start at 50 mph. Your position in the lap stays the same. The same is true if you crash into one of the other cars that happen to be on the track. There are green cars on the track that travel at high speeds and there are yel- low cars on the track that are moving very slow. These cars are obstacles and should be avoided, as a crash will cost you time.
Turns on the track appear suddenly and are very treach- erous. If you enter a turn at too high a speed, you will fly off the track. Don't forget to steer your car when you are in a turn, or you will end up on the other side of the road or crash into another car.

STRATEGY
How you run your race depends on you and your opponent. A conservative race run at slow to moderate speeds could give you a decent time and force your opponent to try to drive faster, more wide open race. The last lap for each player will often decide the outcome of the game. Remember, the winner is decided on the average time of all three laps, so one bad lap time doesn't put you out of the game.
Will your dream come true? Will you will a place in the Ion International 500? It is up to you, the race car driver, to decide your fate against a worthy opponent.
