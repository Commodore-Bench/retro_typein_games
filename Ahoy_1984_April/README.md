## Lunar Lander by Anthony Wood

See magazine for notes on game play.  
Notes on typed-in version:  The first version of Bug Repellent did not take character position in the line into account when determining the checksum values to verify lines.  That makes it difficult to get screen graphics entered with special character codes entered correctly.  The typed-in code to date has the first level graphics worked out, but the second level screen has not been adjusted yet. I haven't beaten level one yet, so I haven't even seen level two at this point. I will need to create a shortcut in the code to be able to work out the graphics on that level.
In working out the level one graphics, there were a couple of changes to the lines that were made that drove different checksums than are published in the magazine.  Not sure why - typo in magazine maybe?
Those lines are:  
 - 1400 KI vs OI as printed in magazine
 - 1700 OI vs KI as printed in magazine
 - 1900 OI vs KI as printed in magazine

 Once I have the level 2 graphics worked out, I will plan to publish the checksums for the program using a later version of Bug Repellent that will detect spacing issues in program lines that define screen graphics.
