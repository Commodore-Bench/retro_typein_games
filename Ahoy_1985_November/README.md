## CHOPPER FLIGHT FOR THE C-64
BY MIKE BUHIDAR, JR.and KEVIN WORAM

In Chopper Flight, you are a civilian helicopter pilot
who has been called upon by his country to fly a
rescue mission. A group of ruthless terrorists have
captured two adjacent apartment buildings in your
city and are holding all the tenants hostage. If their
demands are not met in one hour, they threaten to blow
up the building, killing themselves and all of the 
inhabitants. The nearest military helicopter base is
too far away to send help in time, so you have been
asked to use your own personal chopper to rescue the
hostages. However, the terrorists don't appreciate your
sense of duty and they
start to fire anti-aircraft shells at you. Shonly before a
shell is fired, you will hear a warning noise. If you hurry, 
you can guide your chopper onto a ledge where you
will have some measure of safety. When the terrorists
realize that you could ruin their plans, they send for a
heat- eeking missile which automatically homes in on
your chopper. However, before the missile is fired, the
border of the screen wiU tum orange and then red. This
is a warning that your time is almost up.
As the game begins, you are asked to enter the difficulty of
the mission. The skill level ranges from one to six,
one being the easiest, six being the hardest. The height
of the building and the amount of time before the heatseeking
missile is fired depend on the skill level you seleet. Also, 
your maneuverability varies with the difficulty of your mission.
To maneuver your chopper, use a joystick plugged into
control port 2. To control your rate of descent, hold down
the fire button on your controller. After a short period
of holding down the button, your helicopter will begin
to hover. At this point you can maneuver your craft between 
the ledges to rescue the hostages. Releasing the
fire button will cause the chopper to begin descending
again. Movement in all eight directions is possible. However, 
do not try to move your chopper off the top or bottom of the 
screen; once a section of the building has scrolled off
the top of the screen, it is gone and you cannot go back to it. 
Likewise, the only way to descend to the lower parts of the 
building is to allow your chopper
to drop by releasing the fire button.
On every fourth floor of one of the buildings, you will
see a hostage standing on a ledge. To save him, slow your
chopper's downward fall to a hover and maneuver your
chopper between the ledges. As soon as you touch the
hostage, he is replaced by a heart symbol to show that
he is safely on board. If you allow a hostage to scroll
off the top ofthe screen, he is beyond help and you cannot save him.
If you are able to reach the bottom without crashing
into the building, being hit by a shell, or running out
of time, you will receive one hundred points for every
man you have rescued. Also, extra points are awarded
for the difficulty of your mission and for completing it
in the least amount of time.

## The Knight's Tour for the C-64

By Richard Ramella

A sprightly sprite of a chess knight challenges you to a thousand-year-old puzzle. Put a knight on any square of an other-wise empty chess board. Making only legal knight moves, occupy every square once but no more. It's called The Knight's Tour, and it has charmed and vexed generations since the Middle Ages.
As a Commodore program, the knight is a sprite which can be moved around the board. Score is kept automatically. A perfect score of 64 is difficult. Program logic denies illegal moves: those other than the peculiar L-shaped gait of the knight, and those which would take the knight off the board or onto a square covered earlier.
When the program is run, a chess board is drawn. It has all open squares. At the northwest square is the knight. To take this playing piece to the square from which you want to start play, press the A key for north, Z key for south, comma key for west, and period key for east. At this stage it will travel freely in all directions.
On arriving at the chosen start square, press key K for knight. From this point you must make only legal knight moves. Use the directional keys to go one square in one direction and two in another (or first two squares, then one). Each square occupied will fill with a pattern and may not be entered again. Attempted illegal moves take the knight back to the square it just left.
Beware of leaving inaccessible squares and of moving the knight into a square from which no next move is possible. If this happens, the game is over. To play again, press the RUN STOP key and run the program once more.

## Slither for the C-64

By Nat Koch

Got fast reflexes? Then Slither is for you. The object is to collect prizes from the 40 rooms of a deserted castle by maneuvering the snake and avoiding walls and the snake's tail, which grows continuously (use a joystick in port 2). Collide with either, and you lose a life (you start with seven). If you succeed in gulping down the prize, you move to the next screen; the screens get more difficult as you go along. After you complete a screen you get a bonus which is the same as the value of the prize on the next screen. If you complete all 40, you get a bonus equal to the sum of the values of all 12 prizes (1,860).
When you run Slither, after a delay of about 20 seconds the title screen appears and you'll be prompted to enter the difficulty (one is best for beginners and is the most playable). This corresponds to the number of prizes you must collect on each screen, so screens on difficulty level two are worth more than those on level one, but are harder. You also get more points for completing all screens on the higher difficulty levels.
The toughest screens are #24 - Deathtrap I, #27 - The Web, and #38 - Deathtrap II. My high score is 52,940, starting on difficulty level one.
