## The Knight's Tour for the C-64

By Richard Ramella

A sprightly sprite of a chess knight challenges you to a thousand-year-old puzzle. Put a knight on any square of an other-wise empty chess board. Making only legal knight moves, occupy every square once but no more. It's called The Knight's Tour, and it has charmed and vexed generations since the Middle Ages.
As a Commodore program, the knight is a sprite which can be moved around the board. Score is kept automatically. A perfect score of 64 is difficult. Program logic denies illegal moves: those other than the peculiar L-shaped gait of the knight, and those which would take the knight off the board or onto a square covered earlier.
When the program is run, a chess board is drawn. It has all open squares. At the northwest square is the knight. To take this playing piece to the square from which you want to start play, press the A key for north, Z key for south, comma key for west, and period key for east. At this stage it will travel freely in all directions.
On arriving at the chosen start square, press key K for knight. From this point you must make only legal knight moves. Use the directional keys to go one square in one direction and two in another (or first two squares, then one). Each square occupied will fill with a pattern and may not be entered again. Attempted illegal moves take the knight back to the square it just left.
Beware of leaving inaccessible squares and of moving the knight into a square from which no next move is possible. If this happens, the game is over. To play again, press the RUN STOP key and run the program once more.

## Slither for the C-64

By Nat Koch

Got fast reflexes? Then Slither is for you. The object is to collect prizes from the 40 rooms of a deserted castle by maneuvering the snake and avoiding walls and the snake's tail, which grows continuously (use a joystick in port 2). Collide with either, and you lose a life (you start with seven). If you succeed in gulping down the prize, you move to the next screen; the screens get more difficult as you go along. After you complete a screen you get a bonus which is the same as the value of the prize on the next screen. If you complete all 40, you get a bonus equal to the sum of the values of all 12 prizes (1,860).
When you run Slither, after a delay of about 20 seconds the title screen appears and you'll be prompted to enter the difficulty (one is best for beginners and is the most playable). This corresponds to the number of prizes you must collect on each screen, so screens on difficulty level two are worth more than those on level one, but are harder. You also get more points for completing all screens on the higher difficulty levels.
The toughest screens are #24 - Deathtrap I, #27 - The Web, and #38 - Deathtrap II. My high score is 52,940, starting on difficulty level one.
